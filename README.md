	Hello! If you are coming from Toyhouse, here's a quick explanation on how running a simple Python script works!<br><br>
	Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
		<br><br>
	When installing, I recommend checking <b>add to PATH"</b>. Next, just click the run.bat file and follow the instructions I wrote for ya! That's all! (≧▽≦) 
		<br><br>
	If you don't have a batchfile in the future but still want to run a Python file, just access the Command Prompt in the directory of the file by clicking the address bar and type <b>cmd</b>. Then, just type ```py [name of your Python file]```.

	I hope this can be somewhat helpful to somebody. (｡• ω •｡) Have fun with your silly rainbows!
		<br><br>
	• You have a choice between having the rainbow change every letter or every word!<br>
	• You can change the hues by editing the hex values at the top of the Python file! No need to keep it a rainbow if you don't wanna.
