	Hello! If you are coming from Toyhouse, here's a quick explanation on how running a simple Python script works!<br><br>
	Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/<br><br>
	When installing, I recommend checking "add to PATH". Next, just click the run.bat file and follow the instructions I wrote for ya! That's all! (≧▽≦) <br><br>
	If you don't have a batchfile in the future but still want to run a Python file, just access the command prompt in the directory of the file (click the address bar and type "cmd"). Or, right click the folder containing the file, "copy as path", run "Command Prompt" on your Windows search, type cd and paste the filepath (cd `<`filepath`>`). Then, just type "py `<`name of your Python file`>`".<br><br>
	I hope this can be somewhat helpful to somebody. (｡• ω •｡) Have fun with your silly rainbows!

	• You have a choice between having the rainbow change every letter or every word!<br>
	• You can change the hues by editing the hex values at the top of the Python file! No need to keep it a rainbow if you don't wanna.
